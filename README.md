# Data-Visualisation-Project

This is a project to create a data visualisation, which has to be inline with The Economist style guide,
The same at first seems trivial but, can be a little challenging.

Within the project, the data has been downloaded from the Website of World Education Reforms Database, made available by Stanfod University.
I have atteched the dataset for your convenience, however, it can still be readily downloaded from, https://werd.stanford.edu/


Steps to get the article:

1. Clone the repository in your local system
2. Run the Generate_Plots file after downloading python
3. Run the Generate_Article.tex by running the file on the Overleaf website ( https://www.overleaf.com/project )
